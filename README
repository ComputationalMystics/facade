Facade is a program that uses gitdm to analyze the contributors to git repos,
organized by projects, on a daily basis over a certain period of time.

It is licensed under version 2 of the GPL.

Here's how you setup Facade.

Server setup:

1) Install Apache, PHP, Python, and Mysql. On Ubuntu 16.04, you can use install_deps.sh
2) Make sure mod_php and mod_rewrite are enabled.
3) Change Overrides None to Overrides All in your site configuration.
3) Move the Facade files to your webroot.

Mysql setup:

1) Create a database, a user, and grant all privileges.
2) Copy includes/db.php.default to includes/db.php, add credentials.
3) Run 'php create-tables.php'
4) Copy utilities/database.py.default to utilities/database.py, add credentials.

At this point, you should be able to access facade's web interface.

Git repo setup:

1) On a volume with plenty of storage, create a repo.
2) Ensure it has r/w permissions for the user account that will run the analysis.
3) In the web interface, go to Configure and update 'Location of git repos'.

Gitdm setup:

1) Clone gitdm from git://git.lwn.net/gitdm.git
2) Move it to wherever you want to keep it on the system.
3) In the web interface, go to Configure and update 'Location of gitdm'.

Worker script setup:

1) Set up a cron job to run utilities/repo-maintenance.py daily.
	Note: Cron user must have write access to git repo directory.
2) Set up a cron job to run utilities/run-gitdm.py daily.
	Note: Should be a few hours after the repo maintenance.

Remember that gitdm analysis goes from the start date up to yesterday, and only
for repos that are marked as up-to-date.  It is best to stagger the above scripts
so that they don't overlap and overload the server.  However, so long as the
repo-maintenance.py script has run successfully at least one time since yesterday,
run-gitdm.py will have everything it needs.
